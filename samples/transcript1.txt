Okay, let’s start with the client onboarding process. We’ve been getting feedback that the welcome emails are too generic and don’t explain the next steps clearly. Some clients said they weren’t sure who to contact for technical support, so they just emailed sales again. That slows down response times and creates extra work for the sales team. We probably need to rewrite the emails and maybe include a short video walkthrough of the onboarding portal.

I think adding a video is a good idea, but we need to make sure it’s not too long. People don’t want to watch a ten-minute tutorial before they can log in. Maybe we can do a one-minute version for quick setup and link to a longer five-minute one for detailed instructions.

That works. Also, the portal itself needs some adjustments. The dashboard still shows a “Demo Mode” banner for paying clients, which is confusing. Support has been fielding tickets asking if the system is fully active. We should hide that banner once the client’s payment is confirmed.

Right, speaking of payments, finance mentioned that a few invoices from last quarter still haven’t been reconciled in the new system. That’s probably why some clients still show as pending even though they’ve paid. We’ll need backend to check the payment API integration.

On the topic of support, the average first-response time has gone up to twelve hours from our usual target of six. Part of that is the increase in tickets after the last release, but some of it is due to the new ticket routing rules. Tickets are getting stuck in the “Needs Review” status for too long because managers aren’t checking that queue often enough.

We could add a Slack alert every two hours for tickets that have been in that queue for more than three hours. That would nudge the managers to review faster.

Good idea, but we should also review whether “Needs Review” is being overused. Some agents just send tickets there when they’re not sure, instead of checking the knowledge base or asking in the team chat.

Moving on to product updates, the analytics dashboard redesign is about seventy percent done. The charts are now interactive, which is great, but the export function isn’t working yet. The new PDF export was supposed to generate branded reports, but right now it’s just a plain table dump. We’ll need design to provide a styled template for that.

Marketing is planning to feature the new dashboard in next month’s newsletter, so we have about three weeks to finalize everything. The copy for the newsletter is half-written, but they’re waiting for final screenshots before they can finish.

Oh, and before I forget, legal has flagged that our terms of service are outdated regarding data retention policies. The current version says we store user data for three years, but we changed that to two years last quarter. That needs updating on the website and in all client-facing documents.

Alright, so action items: rewrite onboarding emails with video links, hide the “Demo Mode” banner for active clients, investigate payment API reconciliation issues, reduce first-response time for tickets by fixing routing rules and adding Slack alerts, finalize analytics dashboard export function with styled reports, provide screenshots to marketing, and update terms of service.

Is there anything else we missed?

Yes, just one thing — we should send out a quick client survey after onboarding to see if the new process works better. Keep it short, maybe three questions, and send it automatically two days after signup.

That’s a good idea, let’s add it to the list. Okay, I think that’s everything for today. Thanks, everyone.
