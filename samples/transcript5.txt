Welcome, everyone. Let’s start with a quick review of our Q2 performance. Overall, we saw a solid 15% growth in new customer acquisition, which is a significant achievement. However, we've identified a dip in average deal size, particularly in the mid-market segment. I'd like to open the floor to discuss the factors behind this trend and how we plan to address it in the next quarter.

I think the decline in average deal size is directly related to our recent product update. While the update brought in new, smaller clients, it wasn't positioned effectively to our larger enterprise customers. The value proposition for them wasn't as clear as it should have been. We need to go back and refine our messaging to highlight the features that truly benefit those bigger accounts, like the new advanced analytics and security features.

I agree. From a sales perspective, it felt like we were selling the same package to every client regardless of their size or needs. My team has been getting feedback that our current pitch is too generic. We need a more tailored approach. My proposal for Q3 is to create dedicated sales playbooks for each market segment: small business, mid-market, and enterprise. Each playbook would include specific product highlights, case studies, and pricing models that are relevant to that customer size.

That sounds like a great idea. We can also support that with targeted marketing campaigns. We’ll develop separate ad creatives and content marketing funnels for each segment. For enterprise clients, we can focus on white papers and webinars that demonstrate our expertise. For mid-market, we can use case studies and ROI calculators. This will ensure that the leads we generate are better aligned with the sales team's new strategy.

I'd like to add that we should also consider a new incentive structure for the sales team. If we want to push for larger deals, the commission structure needs to reflect that. We could offer a higher bonus for deals that exceed a certain value. This would give the sales team a direct financial reason to pursue and close bigger accounts.

That's an excellent point. I'll work with finance to model a few different incentive plans and present them at our next meeting. We need to make sure it's scalable and motivates the right behavior.

Another thing we need to address is the sales enablement material. The team needs to be trained on the new strategy and given the tools to execute it. We should schedule a full-day training session to walk through the new playbooks and practice the new pitches. We also need to get everyone up to speed on the new messaging for the product update.

Yes, training is critical. We'll also update all of our internal documentation and create a central repository for the new playbooks and marketing materials. This will ensure everyone has easy access to the information they need.

Okay, this is great. So, to summarize the action items for Q3: we'll create dedicated sales playbooks for each market segment, develop targeted marketing campaigns to support this, review and potentially restructure the sales commission plan, and conduct a comprehensive sales enablement training. Does that sound right to everyone?

Yes, that covers it.

Perfect. We'll set a follow-up meeting in two weeks to review the initial drafts of the playbooks and marketing plans. Thanks, everyone, for a productive discussion.
