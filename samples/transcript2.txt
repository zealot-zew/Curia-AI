So, about the new website redesign, I think the layout we agreed on last week needs some changes. The homepage still feels a little too cluttered, and the hero section isn't drawing attention to the call-to-action.

Yeah, I saw the mockup you shared yesterday, and while I like the colors, I think the font size in the main banner is too small. It doesn’t stand out when you first land on the page.

Okay, so font size can be adjusted, but what about the product images? I thought we were going for bigger, bolder visuals, but the current design still has those small thumbnails.

That’s because the photographer hasn’t delivered the final high-res images yet. I reached out again this morning. She said they should be ready by Friday.

Alright, so by Friday we’ll have the images, and by Monday we can replace them in the mockup. But then we also need to test how it looks on mobile. The current layout feels fine on desktop but cramped on smaller screens.

Agreed. We might need to reorganize some sections for mobile so it doesn’t feel like you’re scrolling forever.

Speaking of scrolling, what’s the update on the infinite scroll feature for the blog section?

We tested it, but honestly, it’s making the page load heavier. I think we might want to stick with pagination, at least for now.

Yeah, infinite scroll is nice, but SEO-wise, pagination might actually be better for indexing.

Okay, noted. Another thing—what’s our plan for the “About Us” page? The current one is outdated, and I think it doesn’t reflect our current team size or mission.

I already drafted new copy for that. It focuses more on our current values and the sustainability angle. I’ll share it in the doc after this call.

Perfect. Oh, and quick note—can we make sure the new design aligns with accessibility standards? Color contrast, font readability, alt text for images… all that needs to be part of the review.

Definitely. I can run the design through an accessibility checker once the new assets are in place.

One last point—are we still on track for the October 15 launch?

If we get the images by Friday and finalize mobile adjustments by next week, yes, but we’ll have to keep a tight schedule for testing.

Alright, so action items: wait for images by Friday, update mockup over the weekend, mobile testing next week, finalize copy for About Us, and run accessibility checks.

Sounds like a plan.
