So, um, I think we should start with the homepage redesign update. The mockups are almost done, about ninety percent there, but the hero section image still hasn’t been approved. The tagline is still showing “Your future is here,” but marketing wants it to say “Future starts today.” I can’t hand off to development until that’s finalized because the layout depends on the text length. If marketing can confirm it by tomorrow, we can keep the timeline.

Right, yeah, sorry about that, we’ve been waiting for the brand team to confirm the phrasing. They’re in meetings all day today but we can get a decision to you by the end of tomorrow. It shouldn’t take longer than that.

Okay, but if it slips beyond tomorrow, dev handoff will move into next week, which might push back the overall launch.

Got it, we’ll prioritize this. Now, on the backend side, the authentication module is completed, but we’ve hit a bug with the payment gateway integration. In about two percent of transactions, mainly with international cards, payments fail. It looks like it might be a timezone conversion problem in the payment timestamp. If that’s the case, it’s an easy fix, maybe one day. But if it’s deeper in the code, it could take two days.

That’s a problem because marketing needs the payment system working for the early access campaign launching on Monday. If it’s not fixed in time, the sign-up form won’t process payments correctly.

We’ll aim to have the fix on staging by Friday, but let’s buffer an extra day just in case.

Also, quick thing, there’s a typo in the footer — it says “Term & Conditions” instead of “Terms & Conditions.” That needs fixing before launch.

Moving on to content migration, the blog posts are eighty percent imported. Some of the older images are too low-res and need replacing. Three posts have completely broken formatting because the HTML tags didn’t close correctly. Those will need fixing before QA.

Okay, make sure that’s done before the testing team gets the content package.

Actually, small correction on my side — if the payment issue turns out to be more complex, it could take until Monday. I just want to be clear about that possibility now so we’re not surprised later.

Noted, we’ll track that in the launch plan. Speaking of launch, are we still aiming for the 25th?

Yes, if the homepage is finalized by Thursday and payment is fixed by Friday, we can launch on the 25th. If either slips, we’ll likely move to the 28th.

In that case, maybe we should prepare placeholder copy for the homepage so developers aren’t blocked.

Good idea, let’s do that. Marketing can draft a temporary version by tomorrow morning.

Right, so action items: marketing sends hero section feedback by tomorrow end of day, backend fixes payment bug by Friday with a buffer until Monday, content team fixes formatting issues before QA, and design team corrects the footer typo. Anything else?

No, that’s it from my side. Okay, great, thanks everyone. Let’s wrap up.
